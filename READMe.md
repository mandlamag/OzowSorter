# OzowSorter

Ozow is a Test Driven Development (TDD) C# implementation of  simple String sorter. This console program takes any arbitrary piece of text as input, and returns as output a sorted list of letters. Punctuation is ignored, and uppercase
letters are mapped to lowercase.

### Example
```bash
input: Contrary to popular belief, the pink unicorn flies east. 
output: aaabcceeeeeffhiiiiklllnnnnooooppprrrrssttttuuy
```
